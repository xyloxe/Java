=> array:-
~ list of elements of same type , placed in a contiguous memory location.


=> operations in arrays:
~create
~input
~output
~update

=> linear search:
~ used to find the INDEX of element in a given array.

=> to use infinity in java | they are found in java utility package, but might work without it ig
~Integer.MIN_VALUE = -infinity (min value in integer)
~Integer.MAX_VALUE = +infinity (max value in integer)

=> pairs in array:
~ total pairs : n *(n-1) / 2

=> subarray:
~ a continuous part of array
~ subarray exists in array: n * (n+1)/2

=> kadane's algorithm is used for maxsum in subarray and it's an optmised way for it. 
~ Time complexity : O(n)
~ it works like this: makes negative number to 0; 
  only if  negative number is greater than current sum(which is initialized at 0)
~ if number is smaller, it will subtract it || works on single iteration
